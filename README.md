# IOCTL CS2
 
This IOCTL project demonstrates communication between user mode and kernel mode in Windows.
It was rapidly developed, although it is working and should remain undetected on official cs2 servers, as long as they don't decide on scanning kernel with anticheat.
This program is entirely external.
